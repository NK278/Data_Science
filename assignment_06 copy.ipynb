    "Ans: In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the common properties and behaviors that objects of that class will possess. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity or concept that can be manipulated and interacted with in the program.\n",

The derived class inherits the attributes and methods of the base class, allowing code reuse and promoting the concept of hierarchy. It facilitates the implementation of the \"is-a\" relationship, where a derived class can be considered as a specialized version of the base class."
