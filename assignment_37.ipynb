    "\n",
    "1. **T-test:**\n",
    "   - **When to use:** Use a t-test when the sample size is small, and the population standard deviation is unknown. T-tests are often used when dealing with smaller sample sizes and situations where the population variance is not known.\n",
    "   - **Example Scenario:** Suppose you want to compare the average scores of two groups of students (Group A and Group B) on a test. You collect samples from each group, and since you don't know the population standard deviation, you use a t-test to compare the means of the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Z-test:**\n",
    "   - **When to use:** Use a z-test when the sample size is large, and the population standard deviation is known. Z-tests are more suitable for larger sample sizes and situations where the population variance is known.\n",
    "   - **Example Scenario:** Consider a situation where you have a large dataset of exam scores for a population, and you know the population standard deviation. If you want to test whether the average exam score is significantly different from a certain value, you might use a z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, choose a t-test when dealing with smaller sample sizes and unknown population variances, and opt for a z-test when dealing with larger sample sizes and known population variances."

    "Ans: The distinction between one-tailed and two-tailed tests is related to the directionality of the hypothesis and the area considered in the tail(s) of the distribution when conducting hypothesis testing. Here's a breakdown of the differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One-Tailed Test:**\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis:** In a one-tailed test, the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1) are concerned with the direction of the effect (greater than or less than) but not both.\n",
    "   - **Critical Region:** The critical region is located entirely in one tail of the distribution (either the left or right).\n",
    "   - **Decision Rule:** If the test statistic falls into the critical region, you reject the null hypothesis. The decision is based on evidence favoring the direction specified in the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Testing whether a new drug increases the average performance on a cognitive task compared to a placebo.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two-Tailed Test:**\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis:** In a two-tailed test, the null hypothesis (H0) usually states that there is no effect, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) typically asserts that there is an effect, without specifying the direction (either greater than or less than).\n",
    "   - **Critical Region:** The critical region is divided between both tails of the distribution.\n",
    "   - **Decision Rule:** If the test statistic falls into either tail, you reject the null hypothesis. The decision is based on evidence that the sample result is significantly different from what is expected under the null hypothesis, without specifying the direction of the difference.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Testing whether a coin is fair (null: probability of heads = 0.5) or biased (alternative: probability of heads is not equal to 0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, one-tailed tests are used when you have a specific hypothesis about the direction of the effect, while two-tailed tests are more conservative and used when you are interested in detecting any significant difference, regardless of the direction."

    "Ans: **Type I and Type II errors** are potential mistakes made in hypothesis testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Type I Error (False Positive):**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Rejecting a true null hypothesis. It occurs when you conclude that there is an effect or difference when there isn't one.\n",
    "   - **Example Scenario:** Imagine a pharmaceutical company testing a new drug. The null hypothesis is that the drug has no side effects, but due to random variability or an experimental error, the test incorrectly concludes that there are significant side effects, leading to the drug being rejected even though it is safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Type II Error (False Negative):**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Failing to reject a false null hypothesis. It occurs when you conclude that there is no effect or difference when there actually is one.\n",
    "   - **Example Scenario:** Continuing with the drug example, the null hypothesis now states that the drug has no side effects, but in reality, it does have side effects. If the test fails to detect these side effects, it would be a Type II error. Patients might use the drug thinking it's safe, but they experience side effects that were not identified by the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Type I errors involve incorrectly concluding that an effect exists when it doesn't, while Type II errors involve failing to detect a real effect. The balance between Type I and Type II errors is often controlled by choosing an appropriate significance level (alpha) and considering the power of the test. Researchers aim to minimize both types of errors, but there is typically a trade-off between them."

    "Ans: **Bayes' Theorem** is a mathematical formula used in probability theory to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It is named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes. The formula is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Evidence Probability (\\( P(B) \\)):** The probability of getting a positive test result can occur either because the person has the disease or because of a false positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \\cdot P(A) + P(B|\\neg A) \\cdot P(\\neg A) \\]\n",

    "Ans: A **confidence interval** is a statistical tool used to estimate a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall with a certain level of confidence. It provides a range rather than a single point estimate, acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in statistical sampling.\n",

    "1. **Determine the Point Estimate:** Calculate the sample mean or proportion, depending on the parameter of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Select the Confidence Level:** Choose a confidence level, often expressed as a percentage (e.g., 95%, 99%).\n",

    "3. **Determine the Critical Value:** Find the z-score or t-score corresponding to the chosen confidence level. This value is based on the normal distribution for large sample sizes or the t-distribution for smaller sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the Margin of Error:** Multiply the standard error of the sample mean or proportion by the critical value to determine the margin of error.\n",

    "4. **Margin of Error:** Standard Error (\\( SE \\)) = \\( \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\) where \\( s \\) is the sample standard deviation and \\( n \\) is the sample size. Margin of Error = \\( t \\times SE \\).\n",

    "\\[ \\text{Margin of Error} = 2.045 \\times 0.546 \\approx 1.116 \\]\n",
